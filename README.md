# Flask Weather Forecast Web App

A simple weather forecast web application built with Flask using Python. This application provides the current weather conditions and a 3-day weather forecast, with information such as temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed. The frontend is designed with a minimalist layout using HTML and CSS.

## Features

- **Current Weather**: Displays the current temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed.
- **3-Day Forecast**: Shows the forecast for the next three days, including temperature and weather condition.
- **Dynamic Styling**: Changes temperature display styles based on conditions (e.g., hot, cold).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language for the backend.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for handling server requests and rendering HTML.
- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the frontend.
- **Weather API**: (Optional) Integrates with a weather API to fetch real-time weather data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of Python and Flask.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask_weather_app.git
   cd flask_weather_app
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Get API Key** (if using a weather API):
   - Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) or any other weather API provider.
   - Replace the placeholder API key in the code with your actual API key.

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

6. **Access the app**:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
